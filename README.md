- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @wizardofgit!
-  Iâ€™m interested in software development and data science
- ðŸŽ“Currently studying Systems Engineering at WrocÅ‚aw University of Science and Technology
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ðŸ‘€ Looking forward to working on some interesting projects! 

I'm familiar with these python modules: numpy, pyplot, pandas, flask, request, paho.mqtt, scipy, scikit-learn, json and more.
I also have some experience with C++ (though haven't used it recently) and HTML (mainly forms).
I've also worked with a database (SQL queries) as well as created my own simple one.
