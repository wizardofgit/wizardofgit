- 👋 Hi, I’m @wizardofgit!
-  I’m interested in software development and data science
- 🎓 Currently studying Systems Engineering at Wrocław University of Science and Technology
- 🌱 My current working language is Python
- 👀 Looking forward to working on some exciting projects! 

I'm familiar with these Python modules: numpy, pyplot, pandas, flask, request, paho.mqtt, scipy, scikit-learn, json and more.
I also have some experience with C++ (though I haven't used it recently) and HTML (mainly forms).
I've also worked with a database (SQL queries) as well as created my own simple one.
