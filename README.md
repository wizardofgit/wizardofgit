- 👋 Hi, I’m @wizardofgit!
-  I’m interested in data science and IoT
- 🎓Currently studying Systems Engineering at Wrocław University of Science and Technology
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python
- 👀 Looking forward to working on some interesting projects! 

I'm familiar with these python modules: numpy, pyplot, flask, request, paho.mqtt, scipy, scikit-learn.
I also have some experience with C++ (though haven't used it recently).
